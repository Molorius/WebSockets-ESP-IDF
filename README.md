WebSockets ESP-IDF
==================

An example server for the websocket component on ESP-IDF using lwip netconn. The example can be made with `make` and uploaded with `make flash`.

This repository may not be actively developed (I have since organized development). See [this](https://github.com/Molorius/ESP32-Examples/tree/master/websocket_server) for the most up to date example, and [this](https://github.com/Molorius/esp32-websocket) for the most updated component.

The most updated component, with documentation, can be found [here](https://github.com/Molorius/esp32-websocket).

Some configuration options for the Server can be found in menuconfig in:
Component config ---> WebSocket Server
